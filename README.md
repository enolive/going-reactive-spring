## Demo Code

located under `demo`

* hello-world is a simple Spring Boot Project that uses
  WebFlux for some greetings display
* give-hugs is a project consisting both of a backend
  (powered by WebFlux and Reactive Mongo) and a frontend
  (powered by Angular 8 and EventSource that comes with every
  **modern** browser). It displays given hugs to you and is
  a poor man's version of an event source.
